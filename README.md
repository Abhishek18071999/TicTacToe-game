Technologies used -> Java, Java Swing, Java GUI (Graphical User Interface), and JFrame
The game starts with two players as active members, having a one-print board on the screen which displays 9 boxes (i.e., 3Ã—3). 
The first person who starts the game has to enter X for any one box, followed by the other player entering the O (opposite to what the first player has entered). this continues unless any one of them gets a line cut either diagonally or straight. 
The person who founds the line is the winner of the game.
